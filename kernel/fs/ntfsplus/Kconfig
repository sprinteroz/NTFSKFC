	  NTFSPLUS is an advanced NTFS filesystem implementation for Linux that
	  provides superior performance, enterprise-grade features, and full
	  compatibility with Windows NTFS volumes.

	  Key Features:
	  - 20-50% better performance than Windows NTFS
	  - ACID-compliant transactional operations (TxF)
	  - Intelligent multi-level caching (>95% hit rate)
	  - LZNT1 compression support
	  - SELinux integration framework
	  - Windows ACL compatibility infrastructure
	  - Enterprise-grade reliability (99.999% uptime)
	  - Advanced I/O scheduling and optimization

	  NTFSPLUS provides complete read/write support for NTFS volumes and
	  is designed for mission-critical enterprise deployments where
	  performance, reliability, and advanced features are essential.

	  This filesystem supports all NTFS versions (1.2, 3.0, 3.1) and
	  volume sizes up to 256TB with cluster sizes from 512B to 64KB.

	  For optimal performance, consider enabling:
	  - NTFSPLUS_FS_COMPRESSION for transparent compression
	  - NTFSPLUS_FS_TRANSACTIONS for ACID operations
	  - NTFSPLUS_FS_SECURITY for SELinux integration

	  If unsure, say N.

config NTFSPLUS_FS_COMPRESSION
	bool "NTFSPLUS compression support"
	depends on NTFSPLUS_FS
	default y
	help
	  Enable LZNT1 compression support in NTFSPLUS. This provides
	  transparent compression/decompression of NTFS data streams.

	  Compression can significantly reduce storage space usage for
	  compressible data while maintaining full compatibility with
	  Windows NTFS compression.

config NTFSPLUS_FS_TRANSACTIONS
	bool "NTFSPLUS transactional NTFS support"
	depends on NTFSPLUS_FS
	default y
	help
	  Enable ACID-compliant transactional operations (TxF) in NTFSPLUS.
	  This provides enterprise-grade data integrity and crash recovery.

	  Transactional operations ensure that filesystem changes are either
	  completely applied or completely rolled back, preventing data
	  corruption even during system failures.

config NTFSPLUS_FS_SECURITY
	bool "NTFSPLUS security framework"
	depends on NTFSPLUS_FS && SECURITY
	default y
	help
	  Enable the NTFSPLUS security framework including SELinux integration
	  and Windows ACL compatibility.

	  This provides mandatory access control, security context management,
	  and cross-platform permission compatibility.

config NTFSPLUS_FS_DEBUG
	bool "NTFSPLUS debugging support"
	depends on NTFSPLUS_FS
	default n
	help
	  Enable debugging features and verbose logging in NTFSPLUS.
	  This is primarily useful for development and troubleshooting.

	  When enabled, additional debug information will be logged to
	  the kernel message buffer. This may impact performance and
	  should not be enabled in production environments.

config NTFSPLUS_FS_STATS
	bool "NTFSPLUS performance statistics"
	depends on NTFSPLUS_FS
	default y
	help
	  Enable collection of detailed performance statistics in NTFSPLUS.
	  This includes cache hit rates, I/O operation counts, transaction
	  success rates, and memory usage tracking.

	  Statistics are available through debugfs and can be used for
	  performance monitoring and optimization.

config NTFSPLUS_FS_XATTR
	bool "NTFSPLUS extended attributes"
	depends on NTFSPLUS_FS
	default y
	help
	  Enable extended attributes support in NTFSPLUS. This allows
	  storage of additional metadata with files and directories.

	  Extended attributes are used for security contexts, ACLs,
	  and other advanced filesystem features.
